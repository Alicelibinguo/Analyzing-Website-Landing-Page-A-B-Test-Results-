# Analyzing-Website-Landing-Page-A-B-Test-Results-
I used A/B hypothesis testing in python to help company find out whether the new website landing page has higher users’ convert rate than old page using Pandas and Matplotlib. 
I performed regression analysis using two method -- Using loop to similate 10,000 experiment using numpy.random.choice() function and another method is to use StatsModel package to run logistic regression model.
Lastly, I also merge another dataset and measure effect of country factor using sklearn and interpret results with practical reasoning
